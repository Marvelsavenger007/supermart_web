            <p>
              To participate as a Supermart Vendor, you must permit the Supermart
              App Services to access location services through the permission
              system used by your mobile Operating System (“Platform”). We may collect the precise location of your device when the Supermart Vendor App is running, whether in the foreground or background. Additionally, we may determine your approximate location based on your IP address. We use your location information to verify that you're within your designated region or city when you start or engage in deliveries via the Supermart Vendor App. This also helps us connect you with delivery opportunities in your area and track the progress and completion of your deliveries.

You can enable location tracking through your device or platform settings, or when prompted by the Supermart Vendor App. If you choose to disable location tracking, the app will not receive precise location data, which may prevent you from initiating trips or receiving delivery opportunities in your area.{" "}
